# Automatic-Code-Generator
This is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool which can be used to generate software codes automatically based on Database Model. Users can draw a Database Model Diagram using MS Visio and upload the visio file (.vdx extension) to generate the full software solution. The generated codes will be written in ASP.NET and C# and the database will be in MS SQL Server. This tool will automatically generate the tables and stored procedures based on the data model in the database as well. Users can also specify the database tables from the user interface of this tool if he/she does not want to draw the diagram.
